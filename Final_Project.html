    <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <p> For my final project I created a game that not only is fun and challenging, but also something meaningful to people in need. I created my game based on the 
      <br>Stroop Effect. The Stroop Effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli. This game is very important because it can be</br> 
  <br>used to help people diagnose possible mental disorders.</br>
    <br>  The game is pretty simple but it is hard not to get decieved. Once you hit start it brings you to the game screen. On this screen in the black box a word</br>
      <br>of a color pops up and a different color fills in that word. The object of the game is to press the button in the grey box of the correct color that the </br>
      <br>text is in the black box. For example if the word reads "Blue" but the letters are colored in red then you would want to pick red because that is the filled</br>
      <br>color. After you get 20 chances your score then gets calculated based off of what what you got correct and/or incorrect.</br>
